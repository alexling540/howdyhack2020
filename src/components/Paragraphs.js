                    The facial recognition component is particularly useful in the identification of suspicious individuals when on the scene.
                    One of the biggest problems that spies/detectives face on the job is the risk of being identified.
                    However, if they could first be certain of the identity of a suspect, the detectives could make a more steadfast decision on how to detain the individual in question thus lessening the degree to which their safety is compromised.
                    This function will aid detectives in doing just that by helping detectives identify the individuals at any scene.

                In addition, this tool is also useful in preventing any form of identity theft because it can verify the identity of individuals in any location.
                The applications of this tool range from preventing fraud in standardized testing by helping proctors identify ID fraud, to preventing any suspect from being able to illegally access bank accounts, to even verifying identities at immigration in airports and borders.

                    The adding sunglasses functionality on a photo will enable individuals to edit the photo such that the individual in the photo will be wearing sunglasses.
                    This functionality is useful for detectives in that they can visual messages of precaution to their team, but in the case that their message is intercepted no one’s safety will be compromised because the identities will be hidden by the sunglasses.

                In addition, this functionality is also useful in larger settings if detectives want to protect the identities of innocent individuals/other detectives who appear in video surveillance which contains footage of a crime occurring.
                This is important if the detectives want to prove to the suspect that they had evidence of a crime occurring, and they should turn themselves in, but don’t want to jeopardize the safety of anyone else.
